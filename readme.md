## üß† Model Architecture

- **Multi-layer LSTM network** for sequential pattern learning
- Dual outputs:
  - **Binary classification**: Depression / No Depression
  - **Multiclass**: PHQ-8 Severity Score (0‚Äì8)
- Preprocessing includes:
  - MFCC (60 coefficients), FFT, Harmonic Emphasis
  - Windowing (2.5s, 0.5s step), CuPy-parallel GPU acceleration

---

## ü©∫ Doctor Feedback Loop

After prediction, doctors can:

- ‚úÖ Confirm or correct the prediction
- üßæ Submit PHQ-8 score
- üìé Upload clinical reports (PDF/image)
- üì¶ All feedback saved to MongoDB and used for retraining

---

## üöÄ Running with Docker

Make sure your `.env` includes:
```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://...       # Auth DB
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://...         # Feedback DB
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-key
```

Then build & run:
```bash
# Build image
docker build -t depression-fastapi-backend .

# Run container
docker run --gpus all --env-file .env ^
  -p 8000:8000 ^
  -v "%cd%\server\uploads:/app/uploads" ^
  -v "%cd%\server\mfccs:/app/mfccs" ^
  -v "%cd%\server\weights:/app/weights" ^
  depression-fastapi-backend
```

This project a MFCC-based Recurrent Neural Network for automatic clinical depression recognition 
and assessment from speech model deployed as a Web Application. The model is a based on one of the proposed solutions of the paper
[Rejaibi, Emna, Komaty, Ali, Meriaudeau, Fabrice, & Othmani, Morgan-Hiring. (2022). MFCC-based Recurrent Neural Network for Automatic Clinical Depression Recognition and Assessment from Speech. Biomedical Signal Processing and Control, 71, 103107. doi: 10.1016/j.bspc.2021.103107.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354324031_MFCC-based_Recurrent_Neural_Network_for_automatic_clinical_depression_recognition_and_assessment_from_speech/citations)

The pre processing function and the model itself is slightly altered . The Dataset used is the [DIAC-WOZ](https://dcapswoz.ict.usc.edu/) dataset
